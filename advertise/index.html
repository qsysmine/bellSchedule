  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
    The DHS Bell Schedule app has been downloaded upwards of 2000 times. It reaches a wide audience within students at Dublin High school through a widget, notifications, custom schedules, and other useful features.
  </p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    Students trust the DHS Bell Schedule app. When the schedule for a day changes, most students will pull out their phones and look at the app before continuing. This reliance is valuable for advertising because it leads to more reading of the advertisements versus targeted web ads.
  </p>
  <h2>How will my ad look?</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col bumper"></div>
    <div class="col flex1"><img src="res/img/adHomeScreen.png" alt="This is what your ad will look like on the home screen."></div>
    <div class="col flex1"><img src="res/img/adWidget.png" alt="This is what your ad will look like on the widget."></div>
    <div class="col bumper"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    On the home screen, the ad will be in an eye-catching white box that takes up the bottom 25% of the screen whereas on the widget, the ad will be in a white box that takes up the left 50% of the widget space.
